    <p>TAGS are called MARKUP</p>
    Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs <br> <br> <br>

 Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on

  <ol>
    <li> <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>The exact size at which each
browser shows the headings
can vary slightly. Users can also
adjust the size of text in their
browser. You will see how to
control the size of text, its color,
and the fonts used when we
come to look at CSS.</p> </li>

    <li> <p> THIS IS A PARAGRAPH
      By default, a browser will show
each paragraph on a new line
with some space between it and
any subsequent paragraphs.</p> </li>

<li> <h3>White Space Collapsing</h3> <p>When the browser comes across
two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.
Similarly if it comes across a line
break, it treats that as a single
space too. This is known as
white space collapsing.</p> </li>

 <li> sub tag - <sub>subscript</sub>  <br>sup tag - <sup>Superscript</sup> <br> b tag - <b>bold</b> <br>i tag - <i>italic</i> </li>
  </ol>
<li>Now we draw a horizontal line using hr tag</li>
<hr><hr>
