  <body>
    <p>There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages — they are known as semantic markup.</p>
    <ol>

      <li><p>Strong And Emphasis</p>
        <li>" <'em'><em>This is Emphasised text</em> <'/em'>"</li>
        <li>" <'strong'><strong>This is the strong emphasis or bold text</strong> <'/strong'>"</li>
      </li>
      <li><p>Quotation</p>
        <li>" <'blockquote'><blockquote cite="http://">
          <p>The <'blockquote> element is
used for longer quotes that take
up an entire paragraph. Note
how the <'p> element is still
used inside the <'blockquote>
element.
Browsers tend to indent the
contents of the <'blockquote>
element, however you should not
use this element just to indent a
piece of text — rather you should
achieve this effect using CSS.</p>
        </blockquote> <'/blockquote'>"</li>
        <li>" <'q'><q cite="By DJ ">This is a Quotation by Dhairya</q> <'/q'>"</li>
      </li>
      <li><p>Abbreviations &Acronyms</p>
        <li>" <'abbr'><abbr title="HTML5 just uses the <'abbr> element for both abbreviations and acronyms">My abbreviation</abbr> <'/abbr'>"</li>
      </li>
      <li><p>Citations And Definitons</p>
        <li>" <'dfn'><dfn>The <dfn> element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term. Some browsers show the content
          of the <'dfn> element in italics. Safari and Chrome do not change its appearance.</dfn> <'/dfn'>"</li>
        <li>" <'cite'><cite>When you are referencing apiece of work such as a book, film or research paper,
           the <'cite> element can be used. Browsers will render the content of a <'cite> element in italics.</cite> <'/cite'>"</li>
      </li>
      <li><p>Author Details</p>
        " <'address'><address class="">
          <p> <a href="mailto: kitujain15@gmail.com">Mail her @ gmail.com</a> </p>
          It can contain a physical address,
but it does not have to. For
example, it may also contain a
phone number or email address.
Browsers often display the
content of the <'address>
element in italics.
        </address> <'/address'>"</li>
      </li>
      <li><p>Changes To contents</p>
        <li>" <'ins'><ins>The <'ins> element can be used
to show content that has been
inserted into a document, </ins> <'/ins'>"</li>
        <li>" <'del'><del>while
        the <'del> element can show text
        that has been deleted from it.</del> <'/del'>"</li>
        <li>" <'s'><s>Visually the content of an <'s>
element will usually be displayed
with a line through the center.</s> <'/s'>"</li>
      </li>
    </ol>

<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
		 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		 <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
			 an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
			 of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
			 the other scientific journals her work had
			 appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
			 The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
			 since college, and the longer she spent in these
			 four walls the more she felt she needed to be
			 free.</p>
		 <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
			 sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
			 proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
			 people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
			 many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
			 the secrets of the llama <abbr
			 title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
			 outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
			 she had something better to do.</p>
