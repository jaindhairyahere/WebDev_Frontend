    <h2>Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
    same page</h2>
    <p>At the top of a long page
    you might want to add a list
    of contents that links to the
    corresponding sections lower
    down. Or you might want to add
    a link from part way down the
    page back to the top of it to save
    users from having to scroll back
    to the top.
    Before you can link to a specific
    part of a page, you need to
    identify the points in the page
    that the link will go to. You do
    this using the id attribute (which
    can be used on every HTML
    element). You can see that the
    <'h1> and <'h2> elements in this
    example have been given id
    attributes that identify those
    sections of the page.
    The value of the id attribute
    should start with a letter or an
    underscore (not a number or
    any other character) and, on a
    single page, no two id attributes
    should have the same value.
    To link to an element that uses
    an id attribute you use the <'a>
    element again, but the value of
    the href attribute starts with
    the # symbol, followed by the
    value of the id attribute of the
    element you want to link to. In
    this example, <'a href="#top">
    links to the <'h1> element at
    the top of the page whose id
    attribute has a value of top .</p>
    <p>Sample text for this</p>

    <h3 id="top">Film-Making Terms</h3>
    <a href="#arc_shot">Arc Shot</a><br />
    <a href="#interlude">Interlude</a><br />
    <a href="#prologue">Prologue</a><br /><br />
    <h4 id="arc_shot">Arc Shot</h4>
    <p>A shot in which the subject is photographed by an
    encircling or moving camera</p>
    <h4 id="interlude">Interlude</h4>
    <p>A brief, intervening film scene or sequence, not
    specifically tied to the plot, that appears
    within a film</p>
    <h4 id="prologue">Prologue</h4>
    <p>A speech, preface, introduction, or brief scene
    preceding the the main action or plot of a film;
    contrast to epilogue</p>
    <p><a href="#types">Top</a></p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Linking to a Specific
    Article
    Part of Another Page</h2>
    <p>, the href attribute
    will contain the address for the
    page (either an absolute URL or
    a relative URL), followed by the
    # symbol, followed by the value
    of the id attribute that is used on
    the element you are linking to.</p>
    <p>eg : <a href="links.html/#types">Link to part of other page</a>  </p>
