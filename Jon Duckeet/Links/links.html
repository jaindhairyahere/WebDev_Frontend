<h2>Links from one website to another</h2>
<p>Links are created using the <'a>
element which has an attribute
called href . The value of the
href attribute is the page that
you want people to go to when
they click on the link.
Users can click on anything that
appears between the opening
<'a> tag and the closing <'/a>
tag and will be taken to the page
specified in the href attribute.</p>
<li><b>When you link to a different
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web
address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.</b></li> <li>Browsers show links in blue with
an underline by default.</li>
