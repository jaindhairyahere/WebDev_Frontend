    <h1>Definition Lists</h1>
    <p>The definition list is created with
the <'dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the <'dl> element you will
usually see pairs of <'dt> and
<'dd> elements.</p>

  <p><'dt>
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
<'dd>
This is used to contain the
definition.
Sometimes you might see a list
where there are two terms used
for the same definition or two
different definitions for the same
term.</p>
