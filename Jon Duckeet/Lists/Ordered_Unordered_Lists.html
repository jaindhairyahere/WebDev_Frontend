    <p>There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:
63
LISTS
● ● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
● ● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
● ● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.
Browsers indent lists by default.</p>

<h1>Ordered Lists</h1>
<ol> <h3> Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the <'ol>
element to specify the type of
numbering (numbers, letters,
roman numerals and so on).</h3>

minutes until tender</li>
<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>

<h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
<ul><h3>Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the <ul>
element to specify the type of
bullet point (circles, squares,
diamonds and so on)</h3>
  <li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
<li>100ml milk</li>
