    <p>An iframe is like a little window
that has been cut into your
page â€” and in that window you
can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.
One common use of iframes
(that you may have seen on
various websites) is to embed
a Google Map into a page. The
content of the iframe can be any
html page (either located on the
same server or anywhere else on
the web).</p>
