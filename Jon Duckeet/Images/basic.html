<h1>Figure
Article
and
Figure Caption</h1>
<li><strong><'figure></strong> <p>
Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new <'figure> element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.
You can have more than one
image inside the <'figure>
element as long as they all share
the same caption. </p></li>
<li><strong><'figcaption></strong>
<p>The <'figcaption> element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.
Before these elements were
created there was no way to
associate an <'img> element with
its caption.
Older browsers that do not
understand HTML5 elements
simply ignore the new elements
and display the content of them.</p></li>  </body>
