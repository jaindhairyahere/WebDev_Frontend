      <p>The opening html tag indicates that anything between it and a closing /html tag is HTML code.</p>


    <p> Attributes such as <b><i>lang</i></b> can be used with any tag. </p>

    <p>Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.</p>
    <p>You may know that HTML
stands for HyperText Markup
Language. The HyperText part
refers to the fact that HTML
allows you to create links that
allow visitors to move from one
page to another quickly and
easily. A markup language allows
you to annotate text, and these
annotations provide additional
meaning to the contents of a
document. If you think of a web
page, we add code around the
original text we want to display
and the browser then uses
the code to display the page
correctly. So the tags we add are
the markup.</p>
